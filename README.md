# Car Rental System

## Overview
The **Car Rental System** is a Java-based application designed to streamline the process of renting vehicles. It allows users to register, browse available cars, rent them, and return them efficiently. The system also integrates essential security measures and supports various rental-related tasks such as real-time vehicle tracking and user authentication.

## Features
